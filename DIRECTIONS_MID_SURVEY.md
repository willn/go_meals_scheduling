# MID-SURVEY

## Missing labor

Figure out which meals shifts are missing labor. This can be helpful to do in
advance so that volunteers can be sought while the survey is open. In addition,
this can be used to cancel / skip certain types of meals.

Un-comment `RosterTest::testCompareLabor()`

This output should be helpful in divulging which shift types have the
right or wrong amount of labor.
